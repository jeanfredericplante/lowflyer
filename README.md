# Low Flyer
Finally, science made useful!
Low Flyer is an open zipper app detector. It is based on the magnetometer and accelerometer data of your iphone.
Based on inductance variation from your zipper, and detection of walking pattern based on the accelerometer, the app (intent) is to differentiate based on the amplitude of inductance variation an opened zipper from a closed zipper - and warn you with a soothing Siri voice that your zipper is opened. Timeliness of the warning is an in app purchase

# Analysis
I will post the FFTs I got from data I collected, but I clearly see from the magnetic signal the walking frequency. There was a secondary harmonic that seemed to be there only when the zipper was closed, but this needs further analysis. If you're interested in the Matlab scripts, reach out.
